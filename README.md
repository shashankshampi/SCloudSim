# Enhancing QoS in Fog Architecture using P2P load distribution

Fog Architecture aims at using edge devices to enhance user experience by
distributing application load dynamically across the edge devices. An appropriate solution
should be able to reduce latency, increase efficient resource usage and reduce power
consumption.
The project begins with gaining a thorough understanding of current workload
distribution in fog network. Simulations of same help understand the various bottlenecks
and current resource efficiency.
Based on observation, enhancement in workload optimization algorithms is aimed
by this work. The project also aims at providing pre-emption of services based on varying
criteria such as privacy, latency, etc.
